# File Organizer

A simple Python script that automatically organizes files in your Downloads folder by moving them into categorized subfolders (Images, Documents, Music, Videos, etc.).

## How It Works

This script:
- Scans your `~/Downloads` directory
- Detects file types based on extension
- Moves each file into a matching folder (e.g., `.jpg` → `Images`, `.pdf` → `Documents`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/downloads-organizer.git
   cd downloads-organizer
